# Shaggy-VS-Squidward (WIP)

My first 2d java based fighting game, currently needs a lot more refining such as (attack/blocking logic, cooldowns, better gfx, extend upgrade system, gamemodes). A true work in progress.
Creating this project while learning SQL, and javafx on the way was extremly fun. I do plan to improve and fix certain bugs in the game when I have the free time.


# TODO:
1. Refine attack/blocking logic
2. Add cooldowns for blocking, prevent attack spam
3. Better GFX (everything, menu, background, etc)
4. Displayable top 10 highscore (rather than just rank 1)
5. Clean up main/code
6. Add more attacking options to increase gaming mechanicals
7. ...
